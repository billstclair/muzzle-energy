[muzzle-energy.com](https://muzzel-energy.com/) is a muzzle energy computer, updated, with many more features than <a href='https://billstclair.com/energy.html'>billstclair.com/energy.html</a>.

For development:

    cd ~/.../muzzle-energy
    elm reactor
    
Then aim your browser at http://localhost:8000/site/index.html

After code changes, use `bin/build` to create `site/elm.js`, then reload the browser window.
